# Employee_Management_Application
This is a small java project where I have created a Data management application for employees. Using collection framework two types of employee information has been stored. One is part time employee and other is full time employee. Applying the OOPS concept of inheritance both of these categories have been declared as separate child classes and their parent class is a separate class named "Employee".
The application supports the following functionality-
  Option 1- Add Full Time Employee
  Option 2- Add Part Time Employee
  Option 3- Delete Employee by Employee Id
  Option 4- Search Employee by Aadhaar Number
  Option 5- Display All Employee Details
  Option 6- Display All Employee Details Sorted by Date of Joining
    
The Employee Id is auto generated whenever option 1 or option 2 is chosen. Further there is a dedfined format to enter date of joining to avoid ambiguities in date format. On chooseing option 6 data will be sorted as per ascending order of date of joining.
